# Museum-App
This is the application made by using the Next.js. The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City's museum's data is fetched by API and then the application can able to perform the authentication functionality as well as the search, delete, and rendering with the help of react hooks and libraries. The application is deployed on Vercel <a href="https://a6-met-artwork.vercel.app/" target="_blank">here's the link</a>  


## Objectives

This is the ideal Museum Website which is made by using Next.js and Node.ja mainly. I have created the API to fetch the sample loade data on MongoDB atlas. You can find the API code of backed devlopment in my github profile. As i am also citing it below:
https://github.com/JayAtSeneca/Metropolitan-Museum-User-API
<br> 
Secondly, To develop a modern, responsive user interface for searching and viewing data on the publicly available Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API.  By using the  knowledge of React, Next.js and React Bootstrap to develop my solution.  However, if you wish to use a different UI library such as Material UI, etc. or add additional images, styles or functionality, please go ahead. I have also attacted the linked below:

## Concept I learned and used in this application

1) Authentification from JWT
2) Jotai
3) React hooks
4) useatom
5) Bootstarp UI

## Functionality

User must register by providing username and password in order to use the application. Before moving on to the next step, the user must confirm the password.
The user will therefore log in to the system. The user can access the application with the right information. After that, the user can search or conduct an advanced search to learn more about the museum collections. The app will produce the results based on the search. The user can also view their favorite list and search history. Additionally, the application allows users to delete previously performed searches from search histories as well as items put to favorites. In the future, after logging out, the user can log back in to retrieve all account activity.
